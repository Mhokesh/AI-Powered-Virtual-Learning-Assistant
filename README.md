# AI-Powered Virtual Learning Assistant
  we have Designed this for a website called OLABS.

## Problem Statement
Current platforms lack comprehensive accessibility features, making learning difficult for many students. Challenges include:
- **Language Barriers:** Limited multilingual support restricts accessibility for non-English speakers.
- **Inefficient Doubt Clearing:** Lack of intelligent, context-aware assistance for real-time query resolution.
- **Lack of Inclusive Learning:** Differently-abled students, particularly those using sign language or voice-based interactions, struggle with comprehension.
- **Poor Network Connectivity:** Students in rural or remote areas with unstable or limited internet access experience disrupted learning.
- **Lack of Dynamic Self-Evaluation Methods:** Existing systems do not offer adaptive self-assessment mechanisms to track progress effectively.

## Our Solution
We introduce an **AI-powered multilingual learning assistant** that enhances accessibility and personalized learning through **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
- **Curriculum-Aligned Explanations:** AI responses are grounded in verified educational content.
- **Real-Time Voice Input & Explanations:** Supports **10 Indian languages** for input and **12 different voice outputs** for explanations.
- **Text-to-Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translation:** Bridges accessibility gaps for hearing-impaired students.
- **Offline-Capable Device Models:** Lightweight AI models optimized to run offline, ensuring access for students in remote areas.
- **Dynamic YouTube Captions & Voice-Over:** Converts educational videos into regional languages for enhanced learning.
